# PHP_Projects
The purpose of these projects was to create two programs. The first program, given a number N, generates different shapes using the * symbol. The second program has two functions:  Given two intervals, it prints the prime numbers between them.  Given a number N, it prints the first N prime numbers chosen by the user.
